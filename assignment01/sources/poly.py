Assignment: Linear and Logistic Regression

This file contains the main work to be done.
The functions are:
- TODO design_matrix: Create the design matrix including the polynomial expansions and the constant feature
- TODO train: finds the analytical solution of linear regression
- TODO compute_error: return the cost function of linear regression Mean Square Error
- train_and_test: call the compute error function and all sets and return the corresponding errors
